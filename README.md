# "Dummy Switches" Plugin

Example config.json:

```
    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "IndexCounter",
            "name": "My Counter",
            "max": 6,
            "randomizeAfterDelay": true,
            "delay": 300000
        }  
    ]

```

With this plugin, you can keep track of an index and increment or randomize it at will. This is useful in HomeKit since it provides a simple variable that can be used with automations.
